textbase
========

A Python library to manipulate Inmagic/DBText style data files

Moving this project from https://github.com/epoz/textbase to the Brill
Gitlab space.

What are textbase files?
------------------------

A simple format separating data records with a single character
delimiter, (all files we use have a $ character on a line. For each
record the fieldname is the first word on the line, usually in upper
case. Any text following the fieldname is that value for the field.
Repeating values in a list for the fieldname can be specified on
consecutive lines using a semicolon. If the text value for a field is
very long and needs to wrap, start the line with one (or more) spaces.

Why did you re-invent the wheel?
--------------------------------

We already have CSV files, or JSON files, or YAML, why did you make
this? Well, I didn't invent this. It is actually a format used by a
suite of software from InMagic:
http://www.inmagic.com/products/dbtext-library-suite/

We used the dbText software to create a boatload of data files since the
early eighties, which is a LONG time ago in Internet-land. Those exact
same data files are still used to drive a lot of software, and has
proven to be remarkably useful over the years. Think of it as Markdown
vs HTML, or as a simpler dataformat with über-simple Key:Value records
that are human readable.

Example File:
-------------

::

        FOO A Foo field
        BAR A Baz field with mulitple entries
        ; Another
        ; and yet even more
        $
        FOO This is the FOO field for the next record
        BAR Nothing

The main utitlity class is TextBase. It can be initialised with an open
file, or a string buffer, named sourcefile. Sourcefile is iterated over,
splitting the contents into chunks. Each chunk is parsed and added to an
internal buffer list. The internal buffer contains a dict for each
record. Each entry in the dict is keyed on the DBText record fieldname,
the entry itself is a list of the values.

The TextBase object can be used as a generator to iterate over the
contents, or the Textbase object can be index-addressed like a list.

Example Usage:
--------------

::

        import textbase
        t = textbase.TextBase(somebuf)

        print len(t)

        for x in t[10:20]:
            print x.keys()

        print t[0]

If you do not want the records parsed into Python dictionaries and just
want to muck about with the records as text blobs, initialise like this:

::

          t = textbase.TextBase(somebuf, parse=False)


Running with Docker
===================

You can automatically convert all .xlsx files from a directory to .dmp
files by running the following command:

``docker run --rm -ti -v $(pwd):/data registry.gitlab.com/brillpublishers/code/textbase:latest``

This will check the current directory (and all directories below it) for
.xlsx files and convert them to a .dmp file with the same filename. If a
.dmp file fith that name already exists it is skipped.

The Excel file should conform to the following conventions:

-  The first row contains the fieldnames. Fieldsnames are converted to
   uppercase in the textbase objects

-  There MUST be a column named ID in the first row. All textbase
   records must have an ID. If a data row is encountered without an ID,
   it is skipped.

-  If there is no column called TYPE, the filename of the Excel file is
   automatically added as a type for those objects.
